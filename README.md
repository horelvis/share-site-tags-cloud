#Site Tags dashlet for Alfresco Share with D3

This work is based in the dashlet published by Will Abson https://github.com/share-extras/site-tags-dashlet.

The principal differences are:
- Compatible with Alfresco 5.0.x
- The project is built over Alfresco SDK 2.1 Maven.
- Used D3 library to build the tags cloud.
